**SCENARIO**

You are a Data Analyst consultant on a mission in the NGO DWFA (Drinking Water for All); its ambition is to provide access to drinking water to everyone.

DWFA has 3 areas of expertise:
•	Creation of drinking water access services;
•	Modernization of existing water access services;
•	Consulting with administrations/governments on water access policies.

The association applied for funding from a donor by presenting these 3 areas of expertise. This new financing, if granted by the donor, could make it possible to invest in one of the areas of expertise in a country that has not yet been determined.
In this context, you are commissioned to create a dashboard presenting an overview of access to drinking water in the world. This will make it possible to choose the country to target as soon as the donor has given his answer on the area of expertise he wishes to finance.

**THE DATA**

You have access to this data, extracted directly from the company's database to CSV files. Here are the files at your disposal:

•	Data Dictionary;

•	RegionCountry;

•	Population;

•	PoliticalStability;

•	MortalityRateAttributedToWater;

•	BasicAndSafelyManagedDrinkingWaterServices.

**SKILLS ASSESSED**

•	Generate graphs adapted to data types

•	Synthesize results for a client

•	Analyze a customer need to formulate analytical questions

•	Create a dashboard answering analytical questions

**YOUR MISSIONS**

*MISSION NO. 1*

•	a dashboard to identify countries that are experiencing difficulties in accessing drinking water in order to identify the countries in which to concentrate:
      o	a global view with an aggregation of indicators at the level worldwide;
      o	a continental view with aggregated indicators for the continent selected by the user;
      o	a national view with the indicators for the country selected by the user.
•	indicators relating to company’s 3 areas of expertise:
      o	the mortality rate due to unsafe water;
      o	population / population density;
      o	the proportion of inhabitants with access to drinking water;
      o	the political stability of the country.
      o	the evolution of these factors over time.
•	Calculation of indicators at the national level for the 3 areas of expertise:
      o	Domain 1 (service creation): graph combining the rate access to drinking water and the urban population rate. Indeed, developing infrastructure when the population is concentrated in the city is not the same task as doing it with rural populations.
      o	Domain 2 (service modernization): Need a chart which combines the rate of “basic” (infrastructure) services and the rate of quality infrastructure (qualified as “safely managed” in the data) in order to identify the countries which, have a great need improve the quality of their services
      o	Domain 3 (consulting): Need for a graph combining the effectiveness of the government policy on access to water (policy efficient = low mortality rate + good access for residents to drinking water services) as well as political stability (indeed, difficult to consult with an administration if the political situation is unstable).

*MISSION NO. 2*

•	to summarize company’s requests via a document by presenting the indicators that you have chosen to visualize for each view and for each area of expertise.
